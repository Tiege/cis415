Trevor Jones CIS 415 Project 1
The first three iterations (thv1, thv2, thv3) all work correctly as expected. The only issue is I am not sure why when using command's such as 'ls' and 'ps' the display is not showing. However they display and work correctly using other commands, such as 'date', 'pwd', './test'. I did not correct the memory leaks. An issue was holding me up for a long time where my parent was 'waking up' my children with signals too fast (SIGUSR1) causing inconsistent execution of incorrect number of child processes which made debugging later on much more difficult. Fortunately I resolved this by making a minimal delay in between each wake up signal with an empty forloop. I attempted to read and display /proc information for thv4 (you can find it in the sighandler function) but was unable to parse correctly using the p1getline function provided. It produced characters that were encrypted and I didn't give myself enough time to figure out how to resolve this. Aside from that, the functionality of all other iterations should be correct. Parsing the command line arguements is ugly but functional as I was pressed for time to work on more difficult concepts such as the round robin scheduling and child process reaping, but I managed to implement those successfully.

It has come to my attention very late that this report may be inconsistent with what your test scripts may produce as I have not tested it using the virtual machine arch linux. I use virtualbox for all of my linux-based programming but I was unaware of such major differences for compiling between the Arch image provided and my apparent Ubuntu version. Please do not think that I am lying as I am already at my wit's end following mid terms and this project so I hope you can see the accomplishments and work I have supplied in this program. Thank you for your time! :)
